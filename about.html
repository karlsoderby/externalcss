 <h1>About</h1>
    I work as an interaction designer in Malmö, Sweden. I work with product development, workflow management,
    technical writing and prototyping with electronics and code. I love creating fun, creative and educational first time experiences
    with complex products.  As a designer, I always strive for every single element of a product or service to make sense, and have value. Quality over quantity, always.
    <br><br>

   
    I've spent most of my professional career working in the educational sector, collaborating with people around the world to provide educational experiences
    within technology, from kids all the way to university. I always try to learn new tools, methods and stay on top of emerging technologies. I am currently researching and working
    with <span class="yellow">Internet of Things.</span>
    <br><br>
    
    Since 2018, I have been working at Arduino, a company that designs and develops open-source hardware and software. As a part of the
    education team, I have primarly worked in the development of classroom solutions. My work includes prototyping with electronics,
    creative coding, technical writing and developing content for our online learning platforms.

<h1>Outside of work</h1>

Outside of work, I run a small creative space in Malmö together with some friends. We try to lift other's ideas, host different kinds of workshops
and highlight local brands in Malmö. This space was founded in spring of 2020, and is run by a community of people with varied backgrounds.
Some of our main goals are to focus on sustainable products and services that benefits the local community, where many of our
projects are centered around upcycling. You can read more about this project <a class="yellow-link" href="https://placeholder.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br><br>
As a person, I'm a nature lover, amateur guitarist and a bit of a tinkerer. I also collect old vinyl and play hockey.
