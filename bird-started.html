<h3>Hum-hum 2.0</h3>

<div class="bread-text-full">


We love hummingbirds but they dont make much sound. According to researchers at Colombirdia and Harbird University, this is causing hummingbirds
to feel depressed and can lead to chronic illnesses, such as bird fever and bird flu. We at Birduino took upon this challenge to
create a tool for hummingbirds to express themselves beyond their silent dances. Several hummingbirds took part of this survey, some 
choose to remain anonymous.

<h3>
The research
</h3>

The research began by interviewing several hummingbirds to gain a better view on the problem. Three hummingbirds agreed to have their name and 
picture published. Below is a sample of an interview:
<br><br>
<b>Victor, 21 bird years old</b>
<br><br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> How does the silence and lack of sound production affect your day to day life?
<br>
<b>Victor:</b> *<i>Intense vibration caused by rapid wing movement.</i>*
<br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> And can you see a problem in this?
<br>
<b>Victor:</b> *<i>Craps on the floor and leaves</i>*<br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> Thank you for your time.
<br><br>
Based on data collected from interviews, we needed to find a solution for hummingbirds to express themselves through sound.

<h3>The solution</h3>

<div class="codebk">
<code>
int BUZZER = 5;<br>
int light_sensor = A0;<br>
int sound_sensor = A1;<br>
void setup()<br>
{<br>
  // put your setup code here, to run once:<br>
  pinMode(BUZZER, OUTPUT);<br>
}<br>
void loop()<br>
{<br>
  int raw_light = analogRead(light_sensor); // read the raw value from light_sensor pin (A0)<br>
  int light = map(raw_light, 0, 800, 0, 85); // map the value from 0, 1023 to 0, 100<br>
  int soundValue = 0; //create variable to store many different readings<br>
  for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) //create a for loop to read<br>
  {<br>
    soundValue += analogRead(sound_sensor);   //read the sound sensor<br>
  }<br>
  soundValue >>= 5; //bitshift operation<br>
  int sounds = map(soundValue, 0, 800, 0, 500);<br>
  tone(BUZZER, light); //Set the voltage to high and makes a noise<br>
  delay(sounds);//Waits for 1000 milliseconds<br>
  noTone(BUZZER);//Sets the voltage to low and makes no noise<br>
}<br>
