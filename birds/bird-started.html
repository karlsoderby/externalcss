<h3>Keep on beekin'</h3>
<div class="bread-text-full">
Hum Hum 2.0 is a technology designed to help hummingbirds express themselves. As they are unable to produce much sound, we at Hum Hum 
decided to deal with this problem that affects hummingbirds all over the world.
<br><br>
The way it works is that vibrations caused by hummingbirds is snapped up by Hum Hum 2.0, which translates the input signals to
sound through high-end piezo speakers. The algorithm has been in development for over 6 years, which is compatible with BirdScript, 
BirdSharp and B++. Hum Hum 2.0 is open source and free for any winged creature to use (minus pheasants). 
<br><br>
When the sound is outputted, it creates some good vibes' around the pack, which can attract other bird species, again paving way for a more
multi-cultural bird society. As it helps the hummingbirds express themselves, science tells us that they are approx. 169% more likely 
to find a mating partner, and that they will definitely have a good ol' time.

  <h3>The research</h3>
We love hummingbirds but they dont make much sound. According to researchers at Colombirdia and Harbird University, this is causing hummingbirds
to feel depressed and can lead to chronic illnesses, such as bird fever and bird flu. We at Hum Hum took upon this challenge to
create a tool for hummingbirds to express themselves beyond their silent dances. Several hummingbirds took part of this survey, some 
choose to remain anonymous.

<img src="img/user_test.png" alt="Paris" width="100%" height="100%">

The research began by interviewing several hummingbirds to gain a better view on the problem. Three hummingbirds agreed to have their name and 
picture published. Below is a sample of an interview:
<br><br>
<b>Victor, 21 bird years old</b>
<br><br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> How does the silence and lack of sound production affect your day to day life?
<br>
<b>Victor:</b> *<i>Intense vibration caused by rapid wing movement.</i>*
<br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> And can you see a problem in this?
<br>
<b>Victor:</b> *<i>Craps on the floor and leaves</i>*<br>
<b>Interviewer:</b> Thank you for your time.
<br><br>
Based on data collected from interviews, we needed to find a solution for hummingbirds to express themselves through sound.

<code>
int BUZZER = 5;<br>
int light_sensor = A0;<br>
int sound_sensor = A1;<br>
void setup()<br>

}<br>
void loop()<br>
{<br>
  int raw_light = analogRead(light_sensor); // read the raw value from light_sensor pin (A0)<br>
  int light = map(raw_light, 0, 800, 0, 85); // map the value from 0, 1023 to 0, 100<br>
  int soundValue = 0; //create variable to store many different readings<br>
  for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) //create a for loop to read<br>
  {<br>
    soundValue += analogRead(sound_sensor);   //read the sound sensor<br>
  }<br>
  soundValue >>= 5; //bitshift operation<br>
  int sounds = map(soundValue, 0, 800, 0, 500);<br>
  tone(BUZZER, light); //Set the voltage to high and makes a noise<br>
  delay(sounds);//Waits for 1000 milliseconds<br>
  noTone(BUZZER);//Sets the voltage to low and makes no noise<br>
